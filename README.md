## Hi! I'm Zackary. ðŸ‘‹

As a software developer and educator, my expertise lies in information security and programming. I'm passionate about learning, creating, and demystifying complex tech topics for broader understanding.

My work primarily involves JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust. Recently, I've become deeply interested in optimizing engineering and architecture practices.
