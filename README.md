## Hi! I'm Zackary. ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in information security and full-stack development, combining deep technical expertise with proven leadership and mentoring capabilities. My approach centers on translating complex concepts into actionable insights, and developing both technical proficiency and innovative problem-solving skills across teams.

I'm particularly drawn to automation challenges and architecting scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. My work spans secure application development, team leadership, and technical educationâ€”always with an eye toward systems that can evolve rapidly through iterative improvement. I believe in delivering working solutions quickly and refining them through continuous feedback rather than pursuing perfect systems from the start.

**A note on my reduced activity**: I've become more selective about sharing code and projects publicly, as I prefer not to have all my software contributions used as training material for AI models. You'll see less frequent updates from me as a result, though I remain actively engaged in development and education behind the scenes.
